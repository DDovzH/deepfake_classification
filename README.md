# Deepfake Classification Project

## Overview
This project is designed to classify deepfake photos using machine learning techniques. Deepfake technology has advanced significantly, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and synthetic media. This project aims to address this challenge by providing a robust solution for deepfake detection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
### Contents
- Imports Packages: Section for importing necessary Python libraries.
- Load Train Data: Instructions and code to load the training dataset.
- Create and Train Model: Steps to create the machine learning model and train it with the provided data.

## Usage
To use this project for deepfake classification:
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the deepfake_classification.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to train and test the model.
